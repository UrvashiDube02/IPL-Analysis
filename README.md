Our project will help sports broadcasting networks to increase their viewership and engagement 
during the upcoming Indian Premier League season. Leveraging the provided IPL database in our 
project will help them to develop new and exciting content for their viewers, such as pre-game 
and post-game analysis, player interviews, and statistical breakdowns. The network will be able 
to identify key storylines and narratives that will resonate with their audience, such as underdog 
teams or breakout players. They will also identify popular match locations and stadiums, as 
well as trends in viewer engagement, such as the most popular social media platforms and 
hashtags. The goal is to provide viewers with compelling content that will keep them engaged 
throughout the season and drive up viewership and ad revenue for the network. This will surely 
help broadcasting networks and will also help viewers to enjoy interesting and captivating
